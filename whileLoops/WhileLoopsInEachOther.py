i = 3
j = 4
while i > 0:
    print("apple")
    while j > 0:
        print("banana")
        j -= 1
    i -= 1
    j = 4

# the whole code runs three times because i = 3

# in the code it print's out apple then enters the j loop

# in the j loop it prints banana and reduces j by 1

# j loop will run 4 times

# then at the end of i loop i goes down by one and it brings j back up to 4
